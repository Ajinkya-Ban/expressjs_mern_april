                    An About Us page isn’t just where you share the story of your brand. It’s also where you tell your customer what you do for them and how you work to meet their needs in that area.

                    It isn’t so much “Here’s what we’re about,” but more like “Here’s who we are, why we started, and what we can do for you.”

                    An About Us page exists to share a business’ story and history and provide a deeper connection with customers.

                    Consumers want to know the team behind the brand they are supporting. An About Us page provides the perfect real estate to pull back the curtain and reveal who is working behind the scenes.

                <p class="adjust-text">
                    Most importantly, though, an About Us page facilitates trust between the consumer and the business.

                    More than 33% of consumers say that “trust” is a core factor when deciding which businesses to support.

                    With an About Us page, you can begin to form an emotional relationship with customers and engage with them on a deeper level.

                    You can include all of these sections, some of them, or just one or two. 

                    It depends entirely on your business type, including your industry, what you sell, and how unique your products/services are. 

                    On top of that, take into account your brand voice as well as what your customers would be interested to know.

                    As you’ll soon see, some businesses devote one or two short paragraphs to their About page – and that’s it. Others tell a long story of how they were founded, and yet more have multiple pages within their About page wheelhouse. 

                    For example, if your brand is founded on strict environmental or ethical principles, you’ll probably spend more time explaining how you uphold those standards versus a brand that sells a simple, straightforward product.
